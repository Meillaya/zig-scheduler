# Source-of-truth index

This index is the M36 de-duplication hub for claims that are repeated across the
repository. Keep the detailed content in the owning document and point readers
there instead of copying long status narratives into every milestone note.

## Canonical claim owners

| Claim family | Canonical owner | Mirrors may summarize in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project identity: deterministic simulator / scheduler laboratory | `docs/project-architecture-and-status.md` | `README.md`, `docs/roadmap/README.md` |
| Production branch / daemon / service / runtime permission | `docs/adr/0003-m25-productionization-gate.md` | roadmap docs, PRDs, release notes |
| Linux observability scope | `docs/adr/0002-m18-linux-observability-gate.md` | M19/M20 docs, teaching pack, courseware |
| Scenario input contract | `src/sim/scenario.zig` and `src/sdk/scenario_io.zig` | scenario corpus docs, SDK docs |
| Report JSON contract | `src/contract/report.zig` | analysis, benchmark, dashboard, courseware docs |
| Public SDK ownership | `docs/m22-library-sdk.md` and `src/lib.zig` | examples and release notes |
| Production-boundary classification | `docs/m31-m32-contract-inventory.md` and `src/contract/inventory.zig` | roadmap status docs |
| Phase B quality gates and release discipline | `docs/quality-gates.md`, `docs/release-checklist.md`, and `src/quality/root.zig` | PRDs, release notes, dashboard docs |

## M36 maintenance rules

1. Use short summaries in mirrors; link to the canonical owner for details.
2. If production/runtime wording changes, update ADR 0003 or a superseding ADR in
   the same commit.
3. If observability wording changes, update ADR 0002 or a superseding ADR in the
   same commit.
4. If a public contract changes, update both source metadata and the matching doc
   owner in the same commit.
5. Run identity/architecture tests after claim edits.
6. For M37-M46 quality claims, update `docs/quality-gates.md`, `docs/release-checklist.md`, and `src/quality/root.zig` together.

## Known allowed repeated phrases

The following phrases are intentionally repeated because they are guardrails:

- deterministic CPU scheduling simulator
- simulator laboratory
- not a kernel scheduler, daemon, service, agent, or production automation runtime
- offline observability-only fixtures
- ADR 0003

Repeating these guardrails is allowed; introducing contradictory variants is not.

## Export notes

- Phase 1 is an in-process simulator only; it does not spawn or control real processes.
- The CFS-inspired policy uses simple virtual-runtime-style accounting and is not faithful Linux CFS.
- The deadline-inspired policy is a deterministic teaching model, not a Linux real-time scheduler implementation.
- The group scheduling model is a simulator-safe teaching analogy, not Linux cgroups or kernel group scheduling fidelity.
- The topology model is a deterministic teaching simplification, not Linux NUMA or scheduler-domain fidelity.

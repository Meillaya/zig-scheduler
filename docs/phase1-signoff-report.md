# Phase 1 Signoff Report

Reviewed against leader snapshot `9bebdbe` on 2026-04-20.

## Signoff verdict

Phase 1 is now **acceptance-ready** based on the current leader snapshot.

The two prior blockers have been cleared:
- the public CLI now runs scenarios by policy and prints trace/metrics output
- `src/root.zig` now compiles under direct test invocation

## Green verification set

### Build

```sh
zig build
```

Result: PASS

### Active build/test graph

```sh
zig build test --summary all
```

Result: PASS

Observed summary:

```text
Build Summary: 5/5 steps succeeded; 17/17 tests passed
```

### Policy-run CLI smoke: FCFS

```sh
zig build run -- --scenario short-vs-long --policy fcfs
```

Result: PASS

Confirmed output sections:
- scenario
- policy
- completion order
- trace
- per-task metrics
- aggregate metrics
- Phase 1 notes

Golden-oracle values observed:
- completion order: `L -> S1 -> S2`
- average waiting time: `5.000`
- average response time: `5.000`
- throughput: `3/11`

### Policy-run CLI smoke: Round Robin

```sh
zig build run -- --scenario short-vs-long --policy rr --quantum 2
```

Result: PASS

Observed:
- completion order: `S1 -> S2 -> L`
- average waiting time: `2.000`
- average response time: `1.000`
- throughput: `3/11`

### Policy-run CLI smoke: CFS-inspired

```sh
zig build run -- --scenario short-vs-long --policy cfs-like
```

Result: PASS

Observed invariants:
- at least one short task completes before `L`
- deterministic report shape
- CFS-inspired wording preserved in output notes

### Direct root-surface check

```sh
zig test src/root.zig
```

Result: PASS

Observed summary:
- all 15 direct tests passed

## Scope-boundary disposition

Phase 1 review still confirms:
- simulator only
- no real process execution
- no kernel integration
- no daemon/service behavior
- CFS-inspired wording remains educational rather than Linux-faithful

## Reviewer recommendation

Task 3 can now be marked **completed** once the team owner/claim holder performs the lifecycle transition on the integration branch.

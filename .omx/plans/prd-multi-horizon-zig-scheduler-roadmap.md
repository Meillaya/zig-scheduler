# PRD — Multi-Horizon Roadmap for zig-scheduler

## Status
Initial consensus draft for review — created 2026-04-20

## Planning baseline
Repo facts verified on 2026-04-20 / 2026-04-21:
- `README.md` and `docs/linux-mapping.md` still define the project as a deterministic, user-space, educational scheduler simulator rather than a kernel-faithful or production scheduler.
- The existing approved roadmap already freezes a short sequential spine through `M1.5 -> M2 -> M3 -> M4 -> optional M5`.
- The working tree currently contains an uncommitted M1.5-style CLI/scenario/export pass and `zig build test --summary all` passes with `21/21 tests passed`.
- The current simulator already has FCFS, Round Robin, and a simplified CFS-inspired policy, deterministic traces, scenario loading, and docs explaining Linux-inspired scope boundaries.
- `docs/linux-mapping.md` explicitly keeps nice weights, sleeper bonuses, SMP fidelity, cgroups, kernel integration, and daemon/service behavior out of current scope.

## Roadmap goal
Turn zig-scheduler from a good Phase-1 teaching simulator into a long-horizon scheduler laboratory roadmap with a **clear spine plus explicit optional branches**:
1. finish and harden the simulator contract,
2. deepen scheduler semantics in bounded stages,
3. grow from single-core to richer topology and workload modeling,
4. add reproducible analysis / visualization / teaching surfaces,
5. gate any Linux-facing, productized, or production-like identity changes behind explicit ADR decisions,
6. keep every milestone concrete enough for later `ralph` or `$team` execution.

---

## RALPLAN-DR Summary

### Principles
1. **Protect truthful identity.** The repo should remain explicit about what is simulated, what is Linux-inspired, and what is still out of scope.
2. **Advance one state-space jump at a time.** Freeze contracts before adding downstream consumers or multiplying scheduler complexity.
3. **Prefer executable proof over aspirational scope.** Each milestone must be bounded, testable, and reviewable in-repo.
4. **Use gates for identity changes.** Linux-facing, external-data, packaging, and production-ish branches need explicit approval boundaries.
5. **Keep the spine sequential; allow optional branches only when their dependencies are satisfied.**

### Decision Drivers
1. **State-space growth:** scheduler projects become untestable when semantics, topology, workloads, UX, and external integrations are expanded simultaneously.
2. **Teaching value:** the repo is strongest when each milestone teaches one new scheduling concept clearly.
3. **Execution fit:** the roadmap must be runnable by `ralph` for bounded milestones or by `$team` when parallel lanes are obvious and safe.

### Viable Options

#### Option A — Recommended: one long sequential spine with explicit optional branches and gates
**Pros**
- Fits the existing approved roadmap naturally.
- Lets `ralph` own small/medium milestones and `$team` own larger multi-lane expansions.
- Makes out-of-scope futures visible without forcing them into near-term work.

**Cons**
- Longer document with more gates to maintain.
- Some long-term milestones may remain dormant for a while.

#### Option B — Split into separate roadmaps now (core simulator vs Linux lab vs teaching/product)
**Pros**
- Cleaner separation of audiences.
- Avoids one long list.

**Cons**
- Premature for the current repo size.
- Risks duplicated milestones and inconsistent prerequisites.
- Harder for future `ralph`/`team` execution to know which spine owns the next step.

#### Option C — Keep only a near-term roadmap and defer all long-term thinking
**Pros**
- Lowest planning effort.
- Minimizes speculative detail.

**Cons**
- Fails the user request.
- Makes later identity decisions ad hoc.
- Hides major architecture pivots that would affect earlier contract choices.

### Chosen direction
**Option A wins.** Keep a single multi-horizon PRD with:
- a **core spine** for near-term and mid-term simulator evolution,
- **decision gates** before higher-risk identity changes,
- **optional long-term branches** for Linux-facing, productized, and teaching/distribution outcomes.

---

## ADR Snapshot

### Decision
Adopt a 29-milestone multi-horizon roadmap with a sequential core spine and explicit gates for Linux-facing, external-data, packaging, and production-like branches.

### Drivers
- Existing roadmap already establishes a disciplined sequential style that should be preserved.
- The repo has enough shape now to benefit from a broader roadmap, but not enough maturity to blur all futures together.
- Long-term optional goals matter, yet they should not distort the current simulator-only truth.

### Alternatives considered
- Multiple disconnected roadmaps.
- Near-term-only planning.
- Immediate Linux-facing expansion after current simulator polish.

### Why this decision
It gives future execution modes a concrete backlog while still preventing scope drift across identity boundaries.

### Consequences
- Some milestones are intentionally gated and may never be executed.
- Docs and ADR checkpoints become first-class deliverables rather than afterthoughts.
- The roadmap stays useful both for conservative simulator work and for later ambitious branches.

### Follow-ups
- Revalidate milestone ordering at each gate.
- Keep the test spec synchronized whenever milestones are inserted, merged, or retired.

---

## Major gates that future execution must respect

### G1 — Contract stabilization gate
Before starting M4, the CLI, scenario dialect, trace taxonomy, and export contracts must be intentionally stable enough for downstream consumers. In practice, M2.5 is the milestone that satisfies this gate.

### G2 — Identity gate
Before M5 and any milestone that broadens the repo beyond “educational deterministic simulator,” require an explicit ADR that says whether the project remains simulator-only, becomes a broader scheduler lab, or grows Linux-facing branches.

### G3 — External evidence gate
Any branch that ingests real Linux traces, kernel data, or benchmark corpora from outside the repo must first pass the approval event defined by M18. M18 is the planning gate for this branch, not a downstream consumer of an earlier gate.

### G4 — Productionization gate
Any daemon/service/agent/automation branch must first pass the re-charter defined by M25. M25 is the planning gate for this branch, not a downstream consumer of an earlier gate.

---

## Horizon overview

### Near-term horizon
Finish simulator contract stabilization, richer semantics, multicore support, and first analysis surfaces.

### Mid-term horizon
Deepen workload realism, extensibility, topology modeling, and reproducible experimentation while staying simulator-first.

### Long-term horizon
Explore optional branches: Linux-facing observability, calibration, distribution, teaching products, and production-like orchestration — all explicitly gated.

## Track classification after M5 (approved by `docs/adr/0001-m5-project-identity.md`)
- **Mainline core branch:** `M6 -> M17`
- **Planning gates:** `M5`, `M18`, `M25`
- **Optional Linux-observability branch:** `M19 -> M20` after `M18` approval
- **Optional distribution / teaching branch:** `M21 -> M23` after core export-analysis maturity
- **Optional library branch:** `M22` when embedding/API goals justify it
- **Optional research branch:** `M24` once policy/testing boundaries are mature
- **Optional production branch:** `M26` only after `M25` re-charter

Future executors should treat the optional branches as **branch tracks**, not as mandatory serialized backlog after the core spine. `M5` is the identity/eligibility gate for all post-Phase-1 branch work; `M18` and `M25` add narrower gate checks for Linux-observability and productionization.

---

## Where future `$team` parallelization is especially valuable
- **M3 / M12**: split engine state, trace/export, fixtures/invariants, and docs.
- **M4 / M15 / M21**: split data model, rendering/UI, golden artifacts, and verification.
- **M6 / M7 / M11**: split scenario/schema, engine semantics, policy changes, and docs/tests.
- **M19 / M20**: split import adapters, provenance/docs, comparison logic, and verification.
- **M23 / M26**: split docs/UX, packaging, examples, and validation.

## Available agent types for follow-up execution
- `architect` — ADRs, boundaries, dependency checks, identity-gate review
- `planner` — milestone slicing, revisions, sequencing updates
- `executor` — implementation for code-bearing milestones
- `test-engineer` — fixture design, invariant suites, regression hardening
- `verifier` — acceptance evidence, claim validation, artifact auditing
- `writer` — README/docs/courseware/report pipelines
- `critic` — challenge milestone scope or gate decisions before execution
- `explore` — fast repo lookup during milestone prep or execution
- `researcher` — only when later milestones depend on official docs/external formats

## Suggested reasoning levels by lane
- Architecture / ADR / identity gates: **high**
- Milestone planning updates: **medium**
- Repo-local file/symbol lookup: **low**
- Code implementation: **high** for state-model milestones, **medium** for bounded contract passes
- Verification / acceptance review: **high**
- Documentation refresh: **medium**

## Execution guidance for `ralph` vs `$team`

### Use `ralph` when
- the milestone is mostly sequential and bounded,
- the write surface is small or medium,
- the verification story is straightforward,
- the milestone is contract hardening, docs, test corpus work, or focused semantics.

Best `ralph` candidates: `M1.5`, `M2`, `M2.5`, `M3.5`, `M4.5`, `M8`, `M13`, `M16`, `M17`, `M22`, `M24`.

### Use `$team` when
- the milestone touches engine + schema + export + docs simultaneously,
- the state-space jump is large,
- parallel lanes are obvious and disjoint enough,
- a dedicated verification lane adds value before merge.

Best `$team` candidates: `M3`, `M4`, `M6`, `M7`, `M9`, `M11`, `M12`, `M14`, `M15`, `M19`, `M20`, `M21`, `M23`, `M26`.

## Explicit launch hints
- `ralph`: `\$ralph Execute milestone M2 from .omx/plans/prd-multi-horizon-zig-scheduler-roadmap.md and verify against .omx/plans/test-spec-multi-horizon-zig-scheduler-roadmap.md.`
- `team`: `\$team Execute milestone M3 from .omx/plans/prd-multi-horizon-zig-scheduler-roadmap.md and verify against .omx/plans/test-spec-multi-horizon-zig-scheduler-roadmap.md with lanes for engine/core-state, export/trace, fixtures/tests, and docs.`
- Shell form when desired: `omx team run --task "Execute milestone M7 from .omx/plans/prd-multi-horizon-zig-scheduler-roadmap.md and verify against .omx/plans/test-spec-multi-horizon-zig-scheduler-roadmap.md"`
- Planning gates: use `\$ralplan` for `M5`, `M18`, and `M25`; do **not** launch direct implementation for those milestones before the ADR/gate outcome is approved.

## Concrete team verification path
For any `$team` milestone, keep a dedicated verification lane that:
1. re-reads the milestone acceptance criteria,
2. maps every claim to a specific command/test/doc artifact,
3. reruns the required checks,
4. audits wording against `README.md` and `docs/linux-mapping.md`,
5. blocks completion until evidence exists for every acceptance criterion.

---

## Recommended immediate next handoff path
1. Finish and commit the current M1.5 working-tree changes.
2. Use `ralph` for `M2` unless the semantic package widens beyond weighted single-core fairness.
3. Re-enter `ralplan` at `M5`, `M18`, and `M25` before any identity-band change.
4. Prefer `$team` starting at `M3` or earlier only when the implementation naturally splits into disjoint engine/schema/tests/docs lanes.

# Test Spec — Multi-Horizon Roadmap for zig-scheduler

## Status
Initial consensus draft for review — created 2026-04-20

## Purpose
Define milestone-by-milestone verification expectations for a 20+ milestone roadmap so future `ralph` and `$team` execution stays deterministic, bounded, and honest about scope.

## Verification baseline
Verified on 2026-04-20 / 2026-04-21:
- `zig build test --summary all` currently passes in the working tree with `21/21 tests passed`.
- README/docs still describe a simulator-only, Linux-inspired project.
- Existing approved roadmap remains a valid subset of this larger roadmap.

---

## Milestone verification matrix

## Track legend
- **Mainline core branch:** default sequential simulator roadmap after M5
- **Planning gate:** planning/approval milestone; no implementation starts until the gate is approved
- **Optional branch:** visible future work that is not mandatory mainline backlog

## Branch eligibility rule
- Before starting any milestone from `M6` onward, confirm that `M5` approved the branch identity required for that milestone.
- Before starting `M19` or `M20`, confirm `M18` approval.
- Before starting `M26`, confirm a future post-M25 re-charter explicitly reopened production scope; ADR 0003 currently blocks it by default.

---

## Cross-milestone regression expectations
- Every code-bearing milestone reruns `zig build test --summary all`.
- Existing supported scenario dialects remain tested until a later approved milestone explicitly removes compatibility.
- README and `docs/linux-mapping.md` must be reviewed at every gate and every milestone that broadens fidelity claims.
- Export/trace contract consumers must treat versioned data as the integration boundary.
- New milestone-specific invariants should become automated tests or scripted verification, not just manual observations.
- Gate milestones (`M5`, `M18`, `M25`) stop execution and require planning/approval evidence before coding resumes. Because ADR 0003 deferred productionization, M26 additionally requires a future explicit re-charter before any daemon/service/automation work.

## Team verification path
For `$team` execution, dedicate one lane to verification with authority to block completion until:
1. milestone acceptance criteria are mapped to evidence,
2. required commands/tests have been run,
3. docs wording stays within the approved identity band,
4. any new contracts are documented and asserted,
5. remaining risks are recorded explicitly.

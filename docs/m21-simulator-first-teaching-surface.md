# M21 simulator-first teaching surface polish

M21 is the recommended next optional distribution/teaching cut after the now-
implemented M15-M20 surfaces.

## Intent

Strengthen the repo's local teaching/demo experience without changing the
project's simulator-first identity.

This milestone is intentionally about **making existing local surfaces easier
to use well**, not about introducing a new platform requirement.

## Target outcome

A contributor, reviewer, or instructor should be able to:
- pick a canonical M17 scenario quickly
- run the relevant CLI/TUI command locally
- inspect a deterministic snapshot or report artifact
- follow a short walkthrough explaining what to look for
- reproduce the same output from committed inputs

## Recommended scope

- expand walkthrough-style documentation for the strongest teaching fixtures
- add or strengthen deterministic TUI snapshot/golden proof surfaces
- make local demo commands easier to discover from README/docs
- keep the canonical scenario corpus connected to the TUI/snapshot/report lanes
- prefer committed fixtures and deterministic artifacts over ad hoc examples

## Explicit non-goals

M21 should **not** become:
- a browser-first or WASM-required interface
- a replacement for the existing CLI/TUI/report boundaries
- a Linux-facing expansion beyond the approved M19/M20 observability branch
- a replay-fidelity, calibration, or Linux-performance effort
- a packaging/courseware milestone beyond repo-native artifacts and docs

## Expected proof surfaces

The proof shape for this cut should stay small and auditable:
- README updates that point users at the right local demo paths
- `docs/project-architecture-and-status.md` alignment
- deterministic TUI snapshot tests and/or committed snapshot artifacts
- fixture-specific walkthrough docs for selected canonical scenarios

## Why this is the recommended next route

The codebase already has the hard parts of the local teaching loop:
- deterministic simulator core
- committed canonical fixtures
- TUI + snapshot rendering
- report/analysis regeneration pipeline
- bounded observability branch that does not need widening right now

The highest-value next step is therefore to make those existing surfaces easier
to teach and review, rather than to add a new runtime or widen the Linux-facing
branch.
